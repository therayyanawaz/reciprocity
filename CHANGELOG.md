# Changelog

All notable changes to Instagram Unfollowers.

## [5.2] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Configurable truncation limits** — Compare view max, queue list max, and activity log max are now adjustable from Settings (previously hardcoded at 200/20/20)
- **Dry-run preview modals** — Queue actions (unfollow/remove/defriend), Delete Chats, and Full Erase show the full target list before confirming
- **Cross-tab safety for Delete Chats** — uses Web Locks API (`navigator.locks.request`) so two tabs can't race on DM operations
- **Adaptive backoff on failures** — `backoffDelay()` applies exponential backoff (`base × 2^failures`, capped) after failed API calls across all bulk loops
- **Durable queue activity log** — persisted to localStorage under `iu_queue_log_v3`; survives page reloads. Default cap raised to 100 entries
- **`getActionableTargets()`** — single enforcement point for whitelist-exclusion across all 5 action buttons
- **Rate-limit accounting per actual API call** — defriend (up to 3 calls) and DM actions now record each HTTP request against the 150/24h cap instead of 1 per logical task
- **UTF-8 BOM + Blob download for CSV export** — `\uFEFF` prefix forces correct Excel encoding; Blob avoids URI length limits
- **Enhanced self-test harness** — tests for `formatETA`, `getPageUsers`, `compareSnapshots` edge cases, whitelist operations
- **deleteChatOnDefriend first-fire warning** — toast notification explains that defriend will also delete DM history

### Fixed
- **`backoffDelay()` was missing** — used in 5 places across queue/enrichment/bulk loops but never defined; would throw `ReferenceError` at runtime
- **Full Erase `onConfirm` not async** — used `await` inside a non-async function; would fail to acquire the Web Lock
- **Enrichment metrics inconsistency** — metrics bar and sidebar used different formulas; both now show `enrichDone/enrichTotal` while running and `enriched/results.length` when idle
- **Delete Chats double-counting on error** — `ok++` ran before `await`, so thrown errors incremented both `ok` and `fail`
- **Checkbox keyboard focus loss** — all checkboxes (filter, row-select, snapshot) now have stable `name`+`id` attributes so re-render preserves focus position

### Changed
- **Magic strings consolidated** — `x-ig-app-id` (10 occurrences) and `x-asbd-id` variants centralized to `CONFIG.IG_APP_ID` / `CONFIG.ASBD_ID` / `CONFIG.ASBD_ID_GQL`
- **Queue actions use preview modal** — unfollow/remove/defriend now show a dry-run target list before queueing (was a bare `confirm()` dialog)

---

## [5.1] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Visible in-page progress indicators** for DM actions (Delete chats, Full Erase) — real-time progress bar, current username, action label, and count displayed in the sidebar
- **Multi-strategy token extraction** (`extractUUID()`) — tries multiple cookie names, HTML scraping, and generates a valid-format fallback UUID as last resort
- **Relaxed regex patterns** for `initTokens()` — handles single quotes, no quotes, and alternate key formats; falls back to scanning all `<script>` tags, `__INITIAL_STATE__`, and localStorage
- **Expanded inbox scan** — increased from 5 to 20 pages (400 threads max) for DM thread lookup
- **Broadened user ID matching** — checks `u.pk`, `u.id`, and `u.user_id` fields in thread participant lookup
- **CHANGELOG.md** — this file

### Fixed
- **Critical: `API.initTokens()` was never called** — defined at line 1119 but not invoked from `init()`. All tokens (`uuid`, `fbDtsg`, `lsd`, `jazoest`) stayed `null`, causing the GraphQL delete-chat mutation to silently fail
- **GraphQL response parsing** — Instagram's `/api/graphql` wraps responses in `for (;;);` (anti-CSRF). Changed from `res.json()` to `res.text()` + regex prefix strip + `JSON.parse`
- **Removed broken REST `/hide/` fallback** — `/direct_v2/threads/{id}/hide/` was returning 404 and CORS errors. `deleteChatByUserId` now uses GraphQL exclusively
- **Stray `n` character** — cleaned up a `sed` artifact causing `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'if'`
- **Removed blocked Google Fonts `@import`** — Instagram's CSP was blocking `fonts.googleapis.com`; now falls back to native system fonts

### Changed
- **Actions panel reorganized** — split into three labeled groups with hairline separators: **Selection** (Select all, Clear), **Queue actions** (Unfollow, Remove, Defriend), **DM actions** (Delete chats, Full Erase)
- **Buttons disabled during DM operations** — queue buttons and DM action buttons are disabled while `actionProgress` is running to prevent concurrent operations
